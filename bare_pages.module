/**
 * @file bare_pages.module
 * This is a fork & "fragmentation" of the 'modalframe' contrib module.
 * It provides a generic way to render only page content (e.g. without blocks,
 * regions, admin menu, etc.). Its main purpose is to facilitate the use of iframes,
 * often inside modal popups. Currently supports Colorbox and Bootstrap
 * (sub-modules to activate) - for jquery UI Dialog, prefer the original modalframe module.
